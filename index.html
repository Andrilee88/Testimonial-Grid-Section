                <p class="tp-3 text-purple-550">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                    The next 12 weeks was the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="tp-3 text-grey-4400">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. 
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
                It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ”</p>
